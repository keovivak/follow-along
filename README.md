# follow-along
This repo is just my own attempts
My cousin is doing a 6 month coding bootcamp and is given assignments with tasks
and objectives to complete, I've been helping with advice and I have a general idea what to do
For fun I thought I would try recreating some of his assignments on my own as I help
I am not giving answers or doing the work, just guidance
